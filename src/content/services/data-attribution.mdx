          <p class="mb-6">The biggest lie in digital marketing is "ROAS". Most ad platforms claim credit for sales they didn't generate, while missing the sales they heavily influenced. When you rely on platform-reported data, you are scaling based on hallucinations.</p>
          <p>This leads to two fatal errors: cutting the top-of-funnel campaigns that are actually feeding your growth, and over-investing in bottom-of-funnel retargeting that is just claiming credit for traffic you already owned.</p>
