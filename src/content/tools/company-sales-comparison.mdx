    <h2>How We Calculate Comparisons</h2>
    <p>We project each company's revenue using <strong>compound annual growth</strong>. Year 1 revenue × (1 + growth rate) = Year 2. Repeat. Side-by-side, you see exactly when one overtakes the other. No APIs — static formulas only.</p>

    <div class="glass-card p-6 my-8 max-w-2xl">
      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-black">Formula</h3>
      <p class="font-mono text-sm">Revenue(year n) = Revenue(year 0) × (1 + growth rate)^n</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>When did Amazon surpass Walmart?</strong> In 2025. Amazon hit ~$717B, Walmart ~$713B. The defaults in our calculator reflect those figures so you can reproduce the race — then plug in your own companies.</p>

    <h3>How do you compare company revenue growth?</h3>
    <p>Growth rate is the lever. At 8% vs 4%, the faster company closes the gap quickly. At 10% vs 2%, it's a blowout. Use the sliders to stress-test: what growth does Company B need to catch Company A by 2030?</p>

    <h2>The News Driving This Conversation</h2>
    <p><strong>Amazon's 2025 overtake</strong> of Walmart in total revenue marked a tipping point for retail. For years Walmart led. No longer. $717B vs $713B — a $4B gap that took decades to close. Use this tool to model similar races — or your own competitive dynamics.</p>

    <p>What's Amazon's revenue vs Walmart 2025? Now you know. But the real question is: what happens next? Higher growth = widening gap. Use the calculator to see 2026, 2027, 2030.</p>

    <h3>Dynamic race charts</h3>
    <p>The chart isn't static. Change growth assumptions and watch the lines cross (or diverge). Perfect for strategy decks and competitive briefs. One viz, endless scenarios.</p>

    <h2>How to Interpret Your Results</h2>
    <p>The crossover year is the headline. Before that, Company A leads. After, Company B. But the <strong>slope</strong> matters too — a steep line means fast growth. A flat line means maturity.</p>

    <div class="glass-card p-6 my-8 overflow-x-auto">
      <table class="w-full text-left">
        <thead>
          <tr class="border-b border-black/20">

          <tr class="border-b border-black/10"><td class="py-3 font-medium">Lines diverge</td><td class="py-3 text-black/80">Leader pulls away; gap widens</td></tr>

    <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> If you're modeling two real companies, validate growth rates against consensus estimates. If you're modeling hypotheticals, use the tool to find the growth rate that flips the race by a target year.</p>

    <h2>Who Should Use This Calculator</h2>
    <p><strong>Investors</strong> — model competitive dynamics. Who wins in 5 years?</p>
    <p><strong>Strategists</strong> — plan market share. What growth do we need to catch the leader?</p>
    <p><strong>Executives</strong> — brief the board. One chart, clear story.</p>
    <p><strong>Analysts</strong> — sanity-check forecasts. Do the numbers add up?</p>

    <h3>Understand when growth rates tip the scale</h3>
    <p>Small differences compound. A 2% growth gap over 10 years can flip a $50B race. Use the calculator to see it happen.</p>

    <h3>Market share implications</h3>
    <p>When one company surpasses another in revenue, market share narratives shift. "Largest retailer" is a headline. Use the calculator to predict when that headline lands — and what growth rate the laggard would need to hold the lead. Strategy decks love this.</p>

    <h3>Sensitivity analysis</h3>
    <p>Change one company's growth rate by 1%. Does the crossover year move by one year? Two? Sensitivity tells you how much the race depends on execution. High sensitivity = every point of growth matters. Low = structural lead is hard to overcome.</p>
