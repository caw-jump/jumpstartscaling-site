    <h2>How We Calculate Value</h2>
    <p><strong>Base value</strong> = Revenue × Multiple. <strong>Synergy premium</strong> adds a percentage for cost savings or revenue upside. eBay paid ~12x revenue for Depop — use that as a benchmark for fashion/resale. We use static formulas only; no APIs.</p>

    <div class="glass-card p-6 my-8 max-w-2xl">
      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-black">Formulas</h3>
      <ul class="space-y-2 font-mono text-sm">
        <li><strong>Base value</strong> = Revenue × Multiple</li>
        <li><strong>Synergy premium</strong> = Base × (Synergy % ÷ 100)</li>
        <li><strong>Fair value</strong> = Base + Synergy premium</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p><strong>How do you value an acquisition?</strong> Revenue multiples are common for high-growth companies without stable profits. EBITDA multiples apply to profitable targets. For Depop-style deals, revenue multiples rule. $100M revenue at 12x = $1.2B — right in eBay's ballpark.</p>

    <h3>What's a typical M&A revenue multiple?</h3>
    <p>SaaS: 8–15x. Retail: 1–5x. Fashion resale (Depop, Poshmark): 8–12x. The calculator lets you test different multiples and see the implied deal size. Compare to real transactions — eBay-Depop, other fashion M&A — to calibrate.</p>

    <h2>The News Driving This Conversation</h2>
    <p><strong>eBay's $1.2B Depop buy</strong> — fashion resale, Gen Z appeal, and a strategic play into secondhand. What did eBay pay for Depop? Roughly 10–12x revenue, depending on Depop's top line. Model your target's fair value with the same framework.</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>eBay's fashion resell play isn't unique — Poshmark, ThredUp, others trade at similar multiples. Use the calculator to estimate fair value for any target. Add a synergy premium if you see cost savings (e.g. shared logistics) or revenue upside (e.g. cross-sell).</p>

    <h3>Dilution and ROI charts</h3>
    <p>For acquirers: what % of your market cap does this deal represent? For targets: does this multiple reflect our growth? The calculator's output feeds into cap table and ROI models. Export for decks and board materials.</p>

    <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> If your calculated value lands in the sector range, you're in the ballpark. Above? Either synergies justify it or you're paying a premium. Below? Maybe the target is distressed or you've found value. Use the tool to anchor the conversation.</p>

    <h2>Who Should Use This Calculator</h2>
    <p><strong>M&A advisors</strong> — value targets quickly. Comparable to eBay-Depop and similar deals.</p>
    <p><strong>Corporate development</strong> — model fair price before outreach. Know your range.</p>
    <p><strong>Founders</strong> — understand what acquirers might pay. Are we in the right ballpark?</p>
    <p><strong>Investors</strong> — sanity-check deal multiples. Does this acquisition make sense?</p>

    <h3>Understand fair value before the conversation</h3>
    <p>One number: fair value. Use it to anchor negotiations, brief leadership, or plan your own exit. The calculator gives you that number in seconds.</p>

    <h3>Synergies: cost vs revenue</h3>
    <p>Cost synergies (e.g. shared back-office) are easier to quantify. Revenue synergies (cross-sell, new channels) are harder. Use the synergy premium in the calculator to reflect both. A 10% premium might mean $10M in annual cost savings on a $100M deal — or $10M in incremental revenue. Clarify which when presenting.</p>

    <h3>Comparable transactions</h3>
    <p>eBay-Depop, other fashion resale deals, and sector M&A set the range. If your target is similar to Depop, 8–12x revenue is the ballpark. If it's a slower-growth retail play, 2–5x might fit. The calculator lets you test multiples — use comps to calibrate.</p>
