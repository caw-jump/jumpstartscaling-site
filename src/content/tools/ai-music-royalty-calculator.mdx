    <h2>How We Calculate Royalties</h2>
    <p>Approximate <strong>$0.003 per stream</strong> (industry average — Spotify, Apple, others vary). <strong>Generation cost</strong> is user input. <strong>Net</strong> = Royalty − Gen cost. Formulas are illustrative — real rates depend on platform, territory, and deal structure. No APIs; all calculations in your browser.</p>

    <div class="glass-card p-6 my-8 max-w-2xl">
      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-black">Formulas</h3>
      <ul class="space-y-2 font-mono text-sm">
        <li><strong>Royalty</strong> = Streams × $0.003 (or your rate)</li>
        <li><strong>Net</strong> = Royalty − Generation cost</li>
        <li><strong>Breakeven streams</strong> = Gen cost ÷ $0.003</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p><strong>How much do artists earn per stream?</strong> Industry average is roughly $0.003–0.005. That means 1M streams ≈ $3K–5K. For AI-generated tracks, the question is: do royalties cover the cost to create? At $0.003/stream and $10 gen cost, you need 3,333 streams to break even. The calculator shows it in seconds.</p>

    <h3>What does AI music generation cost?</h3>
    <p>Tools like Google Lyria 3, Suno, Udio charge per track or per minute. Costs range from fractions of a cent to a few dollars. You input your estimate — the calculator shows breakeven and net at different stream levels. Model 30-sec clips, full tracks, albums.</p>

    <h2>The News Driving This Conversation</h2>
    <p><strong>Google and Apple</strong> are pushing AI music features — Lyria 3, 30-second clips, custom lyrics and instrumentals. Creation is cheap. But can royalties cover the cost at scale? Model it. Enter stream count and gen cost — see net economics. The gap (or surplus) drives the business case.</p>

    <p>Can AI music royalties cover generation cost? At low gen costs, yes — a few hundred streams can break even. At higher costs (e.g. full-track production), you need hundreds of thousands. The calculator gives you the exact breakeven. No guesswork.</p>

    <h3>Visual royalty breakdown</h3>
    <p>See royalty vs gen cost in a simple chart. At 100K streams: $300 royalty. Subtract $50 gen cost = $250 net. Scale to 1M: $3K − $50 = $2,950 net. The unit economics become obvious. Use it for pitch decks, business plans, or personal projects.</p>

    <p>Breakeven by generation cost (at $0.003/stream):</p>

    <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Low gen cost = easy breakeven. High gen cost = need viral scale. Use the calculator to set realistic targets. If breakeven is 100K streams and you're doing 1K, you're upside down. Adjust cost or strategy.</p>

    <h2>Who Should Use This Calculator</h2>
    <p><strong>Artists and producers</strong> — understand AI music economics. Does the math work?</p>
    <p><strong>Labels and distributors</strong> — model unit economics. Set expectations for AI-generated catalogs.</p>
    <p><strong>AI music platform builders</strong> — price your product. What gen cost allows royalties to cover it?</p>
    <p><strong>Content creators</strong> — budget for AI tracks. Know breakeven before you scale.</p>

    <h3>Understand the unit economics of AI-generated content</h3>
    <p>One number: breakeven streams. Use it to decide: is this model sustainable? The calculator gives you that number in seconds.</p>

    <h3>Platform rate differences</h3>
    <p>Spotify pays ~$0.003–0.004 per stream. Apple Music often higher. YouTube lower. Our default uses a blended average. Adjust the rate in the calculator to match your primary platform. Breakeven shifts — higher rate means fewer streams needed to cover gen cost.</p>

    <h3>Catalog scale and long tail</h3>
    <p>One track needs X streams to break even. A catalog of 100 tracks needs 100X total — but streams spread across tracks. Model single-track economics first; then think about catalog. If each track needs 10K streams and you have 100, you need 1M total streams to cover creation cost. The calculator handles one track; scale in your head.</p>
