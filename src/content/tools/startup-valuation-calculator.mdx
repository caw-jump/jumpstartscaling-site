faqs:
  - q: "How is post-money valuation calculated?"
    a: "Post-money valuation = Pre-money valuation + Round size. Pre-money = Revenue (or ARR) × Valuation multiple."
  - q: "What multiple do AI startups get?"
    a: "AI/ML startups often command 15–30x ARR or higher in hot markets. Traditional SaaS averages 8–15x."
  - q: "How does dilution work in a funding round?"
    a: "Dilution % = (Round size / Post-money valuation) × 100. Existing shareholders' ownership decreases proportionally."
  - q: "What is runway and how do I calculate it?"
    a: "Runway = Cash ÷ Monthly burn. At $2M cash and $200K burn, you have 10 months. Investors expect 18–24 months post-raise."
  - q: "How does OpenAI's $100B round compare to typical startups?"
    a: "OpenAI's implied multiple is far above normal — 50x+ revenue in some estimates. Most Series B+ SaaS targets 10–20x ARR."

    <h2>How We Calculate Valuation</h2>
    <p>Every funding conversation starts with the same question: <strong>What's our company worth?</strong> Our tool uses industry-standard formulas — no external APIs, no guesswork. All math runs in your browser.</p>

    <div class="glass-card p-6 my-8 max-w-2xl">
      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-black">Core Formulas</h3>
      <ul class="space-y-2 font-mono text-sm">
        <li><strong>Pre-money</strong> = ARR (or revenue) × Valuation multiple</li>
        <li><strong>Post-money</strong> = Pre-money + Round size</li>
        <li><strong>Dilution</strong> = (Round size ÷ Post-money) × 100%</li>
        <li><strong>Runway</strong> = Cash ÷ Monthly burn rate</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>A <strong>$10M ARR</strong> SaaS at <strong>15x</strong> gets <strong>$150M pre-money</strong>. Raise $30M and your post-money is $180M — you've sold 16.7% of the company. Simple. But the real art is choosing the right multiple.</p>

    <p><strong>What drives multiples?</strong> Growth rate, margins, market size, and sector hype. AI infrastructure commanded 30x+ in 2025. Traditional B2B SaaS hovered around 8–15x. Use the calculator to model different scenarios before you walk into the room.</p>

    <h3>Search-friendly: How is post-money valuation calculated?</h3>
    <p>Post-money valuation is the company's worth immediately after new money is invested. It equals pre-money valuation plus the round size. If pre-money is $100M and you raise $25M, post-money is $125M. That $25M buys 20% ($25M ÷ $125M) of the company. The formula is simple; the art is in negotiating the pre-money.</p>

    <h3>Runway and burn: the investor lens</h3>
    <p>Investors want 18–24 months of runway post-raise. If you burn $200K/month, a $5M round gives you 25 months — comfortable. At $400K burn, same round gives 12.5 months — tight. Model burn and runway in the calculator to show you've thought it through. Runway = Cash ÷ Monthly burn. Memorize it.</p>

    <h2>The News Driving This Conversation</h2>
    <p><strong>OpenAI's $100B round</strong> put startup valuations back in the spotlight. At implied multiples north of 50x revenue (or more), it represents a tier of funding most companies never touch. Use this tool to model your own round and see how your numbers compare.</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Elite AI and infrastructure plays get premiums. Everyone else benchmarks against growth-stage SaaS. The gap between OpenAI and a $5M ARR startup is enormous — and that's why founders need to model, not guess.</p>

    <h3>Why valuation multiples matter for fundraising</h3>
    <p>Multiple sets your dilution. At 10x, $5M ARR = $50M pre-money. Raise $15M and you dilute 23%. At 15x, same revenue = $75M pre-money — $15M buys only 17%. Higher multiple, less dilution for the same check. Know your bracket before the term sheet lands.</p>

    <h2>How to Interpret Your Results</h2>
    <p>Not all multiples are created equal. Where do you land?</p>

    <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> If your calculator shows 12x and you're in a hot space, you might push for 15x. If you're at 6x, focus on growth and efficiency to move into the next bracket. Dilution compounds — a few points matter over multiple rounds.</p>

    <h3>What multiple do AI startups get?</h3>
    <p>AI/ML startups in 2025 often commanded 15–30x ARR or higher. Infrastructure plays (compute, data, tooling) saw the biggest premiums. Application-layer AI tended to land in the 10–20x range. Use our sliders to test an "AI premium" scenario and see the impact on your cap table.</p>

    <h2>Who Should Use This Calculator</h2>
    <p><strong>Founders</strong> preparing a fundraise — model dilution before the deck. Know your numbers cold when investors ask "what's your pre-money?"</p>
    <p><strong>VCs and angels</strong> — sanity-check term sheets. Is that 20x reasonable for this stage? Run the math.</p>
    <p><strong>Advisors and board members</strong> — help portfolio companies model rounds. One spreadsheet mistake can cost founders millions in excessive dilution.</p>
    <p><strong>CFOs and finance teams</strong> — plan runway and cap table. See how much you need to raise for 18–24 months of runway without over-diluting.</p>

    <h3>Planning a Series A? Model before the deck</h3>
    <p>Plug in your ARR, pick a multiple, add the round size. In 30 seconds you'll know your post-money, dilution, and where you sit versus benchmarks. No Excel, no guesswork. Then take that confidence into the conversation.</p>

    <h3>Why founders leave money on the table</h3>
    <p>Founders who don't model valuation often accept the first term sheet. Investors have the spreadsheet. You should too. A 2x multiple difference on a $20M round can mean 5–10% less dilution. That's millions in future value. Run the numbers before you negotiate.</p>

    <h3>Cap table sanity check</h3>
    <p>After each round, ownership shifts. Use the calculator to see post-dilution ownership for founders, employees, and investors. Three rounds at 15–20% dilution each leaves founders with 50–60% — if you're careful. Model the path before you walk it.</p>
