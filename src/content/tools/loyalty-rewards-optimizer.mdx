    <h2>How We Calculate Rewards</h2>
    <p><strong>Base miles</strong> from flights, <strong>bonus miles</strong> from card spend, and <strong>cardholder discount</strong> on redemptions. All formulas are static — no APIs. You input the numbers; we show the value.</p>

    <div class="glass-card p-6 my-8 max-w-2xl">
      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-black">Core Logic</h3>
      <ul class="space-y-2 font-mono text-sm">
        <li><strong>Total miles</strong> = Flight miles + (Card spend × earn rate)</li>
        <li><strong>Cardholder price</strong> = Redemption cost × 0.9 (10% off)</li>
        <li><strong>Non-cardholder price</strong> = Full redemption cost</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p><strong>How does United's 10% points discount work?</strong> Cardholders pay 90% of the points for the same award. A 50,000-mile ticket costs 45,000 with the card. Over a year, that can save 20,000+ miles — enough for another trip. Non-cardholders pay full price. The gap is real.</p>

    <h3>Max rewards scenarios</h3>
    <p>Stack flight miles, card spend, and cardholder status. The calculator shows your total earning potential and the effective dollar value of the 10% discount. Use it to decide: is the annual fee worth it? Usually yes, if you fly 2+ times per year.</p>

    <h2>The News Driving This Conversation</h2>
    <p><strong>United's loyalty overhaul</strong> — 10% points discount for co-branded cardholders on award redemptions. Non-cardholders pay full price. The change rewards loyalty to the card; everyone else pays a penalty. Model your scenario and see the gap.</p>

    <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 my-8">
      <div class="glass-card p-6">
        <div class="text-sm tools-fact-label mb-2">Cardholder discount</div>
        <div class="text-xl font-bold tools-fact-value">10%</div>
      </div>
      <div class="glass-card p-6">
        <div class="text-sm tools-fact-label mb-2">Example: 50K award</div>
        <div class="text-xl font-bold tools-fact-value">45K vs 50K</div>
      </div>
      <div class="glass-card p-6">
        <div class="text-sm tools-fact-label mb-2">Annual savings (est.)</div>
        <div class="text-xl font-bold tools-fact-value">5–20K miles</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Should I get a co-branded travel card? If you fly United (or the carrier you're modeling) regularly, the math usually wins. The 10% discount on redemptions plus bonus earn on spend adds up fast. The calculator quantifies it.</p>

    <h3>Non-cardholder penalty</h3>
    <p>Without the card, you pay full price for awards. That's not a "penalty" in name — but it's a relative disadvantage. Over multiple redemptions per year, the gap can exceed the card's annual fee many times over.</p>

    <h2>Who Should Use This Calculator</h2>
    <p><strong>Frequent flyers</strong> — quantify the value of cardholder status. Is the annual fee worth it?</p>
    <p><strong>Travel hackers</strong> — model United-style programs. See max rewards for different spend and travel levels.</p>
    <p><strong>Loyalty program managers</strong> — understand the gap between cardholder and non-cardholder. Use it for positioning and upgrades.</p>
    <p><strong>Finance-conscious travelers</strong> — make data-driven decisions. Don't guess — calculate.</p>

    <h3>Understand the true value of cardholder status</h3>
    <p>One number: how much do you save per year with the 10% discount? If it's more than the annual fee, the card pays for itself. The calculator gives you that number.</p>

    <h3>Elite tier and status perks</h3>
    <p>United and other carriers layer elite status on top of cardholder benefits. More miles per dollar, upgrades, lounge access. The calculator focuses on the 10% redemption discount — but elite status multiplies earn. Model cardholder value first; add status benefits in your head.</p>

    <h3>Redemption sweet spots</h3>
    <p>Not all awards are equal. Business class to Europe can be 2–3 cents per point; economy domestic might be 1 cent. The 10% discount applies to all — but it's worth more on high-value redemptions. Use the calculator for total miles; then optimize where you spend them.</p>
