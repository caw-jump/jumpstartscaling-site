    <h2>How We Score Risk</h2>
    <p>We weight three factors: <strong>content type</strong> (original vs derived), <strong>AI tool use level</strong> (low to heavy), and <strong>training dataset scope</strong> (licensed vs scraped vs unknown). Higher score = higher illustrative risk. This is not legal advice — consult qualified counsel for real decisions.</p>

    <div class="glass-card p-6 my-8 max-w-2xl">
      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-black">Risk Factors</h3>
      <ul class="space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Content type</strong> — Original &lt; Mixed &lt; Derived</li>
        <li><strong>Tool use</strong> — Low &lt; Medium &lt; Heavy</li>
        <li><strong>Dataset</strong> — Licensed &lt; Unknown &lt; Scraped</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p><strong>What factors increase AI IP infringement risk?</strong> Using copyrighted material in training, producing output similar to protected works, commercial use, and lack of clear licensing all increase exposure. Our calculator assigns illustrative weights — use it to compare scenarios, not to make legal decisions.</p>

    <h3>Safe vs risky sliders</h3>
    <p>The tool lets you move sliders and see how the score changes. Heavy AI use + scraped dataset + derived content = high illustrative risk. Original content + licensed data + light AI = low. Real risk depends on jurisdiction, facts, and case law. This is a starting point for discussion.</p>

    <h2>The News Driving This Conversation</h2>
    <p><strong>Netflix's cease-and-desist</strong> to ByteDance over Seedance AI — "piracy engine" claims — highlights Hollywood's IP concerns. Studios are drawing lines. Use this calculator to model your own risk profile. Content type, tool use, dataset: where do you land on the spectrum? Illustrative only — but it frames the conversation.</p>

    <p>What did Netflix say about ByteDance Seedance? Reports cite warnings that the AI could be used to replicate or infringe Netflix content. Hollywood is suing and sending letters. If you're building or using AI tools, understand the risk factors. This calculator helps you think it through — then talk to a lawyer.</p>

    <h3>Ties to Hollywood's AI crackdown</h3>
    <p>Studios and publishers are actively pursuing AI providers and users. Training on scraped content, output that resembles existing works, commercial distribution — all under scrutiny. Use the calculator to identify high-risk combinations. Then get proper legal advice before scaling.</p>

    <h2>Who Should Use This Calculator</h2>
    <p><strong>Content creators</strong> — assess where you land. Original vs derived, licensed vs scraped. Understand the spectrum.</p>
    <p><strong>AI tool users</strong> — model different usage levels. Heavy reliance vs light assist — how does risk change?</p>
    <p><strong>Legal and compliance teams</strong> — start the conversation. Use scores to prioritize review and counsel.</p>
    <p><strong>Executives and product leads</strong> — understand exposure before scaling AI features. One slider session can reveal hotspots.</p>

    <h3>Understand risk factors before scaling AI-generated content</h3>
    <p>Don't guess. Run scenarios. See how content type, tool use, and dataset interact. Then take the output to counsel — and make informed decisions.</p>

    <h3>Training data and output similarity</h3>
    <p>Risk often correlates with training data. Scraped copyrighted content = higher risk. Licensed or original = lower. Output that closely resembles specific works (e.g. a song that sounds like a known hit) amplifies exposure. The calculator weighs these; real analysis requires legal review of your specific facts.</p>

    <h3>Commercial vs non-commercial use</h3>
    <p>Personal use, research, and parody have different legal treatment than commercial distribution. Our calculator doesn't distinguish — it scores content and tool factors. For commercial use, assume higher scrutiny. Consult counsel before monetizing AI-generated content at scale.</p>
