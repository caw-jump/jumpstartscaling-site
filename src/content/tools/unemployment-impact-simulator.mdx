    <h2>How We Calculate Impact</h2>
    <p><strong>Runway</strong> = Savings ÷ Monthly expenses. <strong>Savings drain</strong> = Monthly expenses × Duration. Simple, but powerful. No APIs — you control every input. The calculator shows how long your money lasts and how much you'd burn over a given period.</p>

    <div class="glass-card p-6 my-8 max-w-2xl">
      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-black">Formulas</h3>
      <ul class="space-y-2 font-mono text-sm">
        <li><strong>Runway (months)</strong> = Savings ÷ Monthly expenses</li>
        <li><strong>Savings drain</strong> = Expenses × Duration</li>
        <li><strong>Remaining</strong> = Savings − Drain</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p><strong>How do I calculate financial runway?</strong> Add up your essential monthly expenses — rent, utilities, food, insurance, debt minimums. Divide your liquid savings by that number. At $60K savings and $5K/month expenses, you have 12 months. That's your runway. The calculator does it in seconds.</p>

    <h3>Probability-based what-if</h3>
    <p>Jobless claims at 206K suggest labor market resilience. But long-term unemployment can rise even as new claims fall. Model your personal runway under different duration assumptions: 3 months, 6 months, 12 months. Know your floor before you need it.</p>

    <h2>The News Driving This Conversation</h2>
    <p><strong>Jobless claims at 206K</strong> — down 23K from the prior week. Headlines say labor market strength. But long-term unemployment is ticking up. What does that mean for you? Model your financial runway. If you lost your job tomorrow, how long would savings last?</p>

    <p>What if jobless claims fall but long-term unemployment rises? New filings can drop while people already unemployed stay out longer. Both metrics matter. For personal planning, focus on your own runway — the calculator ignores macro noise and shows your numbers.</p>

    <h3>Savings drain visualization</h3>
    <p>See your balance month by month. How fast does $80K disappear at $6K/month? In 13 months. The chart makes it visceral. Adjust expenses or savings and watch the line move. It's the best motivator to build a larger cushion.</p>

    <p><strong>How much should I save for job loss?</strong> Standard advice: 3–6 months of expenses. In volatile sectors or uncertain times, aim for 6–12. Use the calculator to see your actual runway — then set a target and build toward it.</p>

    <h2>Who Should Use This Calculator</h2>
    <p><strong>Individuals</strong> — plan finances. Know your runway before you need it.</p>
    <p><strong>Financial advisors</strong> — show clients the impact of job loss. Make it tangible.</p>
    <p><strong>Career changers</strong> — model the transition. How long can you fund a job search?</p>
    <p><strong>Anyone in volatile industries</strong> — tech, media, retail. Build the cushion the calculator reveals you need.</p>

    <h3>Know your runway before you need it</h3>
    <p>Hope for the best, plan for the worst. One calculation, lifetime clarity. Adjust expenses, savings, and duration — see the impact in real time.</p>

    <h3>Emergency fund vs runway</h3>
    <p>Runway and emergency fund are related but different. Emergency fund = 3–6 months expenses for unexpected costs. Runway = how long you can sustain full expenses without income. Job loss is the extreme case. The calculator handles both — same formula, different framing.</p>

    <h3>Cutting expenses to extend runway</h3>
    <p>If you reduce monthly expenses by 20%, runway extends by 25%. The math: $60K ÷ $5K = 12 months. Cut to $4K and you get 15 months. The calculator lets you model "what if I cut to $X?" — see the runway extension instantly. Useful for planning lifestyle changes.</p>
