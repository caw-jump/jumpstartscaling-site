    <h2>How We Calculate Impact</h2>
    <p><strong>Share of cap</strong> = Salary ÷ Team cap. <strong>Lost earnings</strong> = (Salary ÷ 365) × Strike days. Simple formulas — no APIs. You input salary, cap (if applicable), and strike duration. The calculator shows cap share, daily lost pay, and total impact.</p>

    <div class="glass-card p-6 my-8 max-w-2xl">
      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-black">Formulas</h3>
      <ul class="space-y-2 font-mono text-sm">
        <li><strong>Cap share %</strong> = (Salary ÷ Team cap) × 100</li>
        <li><strong>Daily earnings</strong> = Salary ÷ 365</li>
        <li><strong>Lost earnings</strong> = Daily × Strike days</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p><strong>How do you calculate strike impact on player earnings?</strong> A $10M player earns ~$27,397 per day. A 30-day strike costs $821,918. The math is straightforward — the calculator makes it instant. Use it for MLB, NBA, or any labor scenario with salary and days lost.</p>

    <h3>What is salary cap share?</h3>
    <p>In cap leagues, each player's salary consumes a slice of the team's total cap. A $30M player on a $200M cap = 15%. That leaves 85% for the rest of the roster. The calculator shows the share so you can see how one contract affects the whole.</p>

    <h2>The News Driving This Conversation</h2>
    <p><strong>MLBPA federal probe</strong> and Tony Clark's resignation signal turbulence ahead. Labor war looms. What happens to player earnings during a strike? Model it. Enter salary and strike duration — see the dollar impact. Owners and players both run these numbers before they dig in.</p>

    <p>What happened with MLBPA and Tony Clark? Resignation amid federal probe. Labor relations are strained. Cap fights and work stoppages are possible. The calculator doesn't predict — it quantifies. If there's a strike, how much do players lose? Plug in the numbers.</p>

    <h3>Cap fight dynamics</h3>
    <p>When owners want a harder cap and players want more share, the math matters. A $5M raise for one star means $5M less for the rest of the roster. The calculator shows cap share so both sides can model the tradeoffs.</p>

    <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> High earners lose more in absolute terms. But as a share of salary, everyone loses the same (days ÷ 365). Use the calculator to see both: total dollars and percentage of annual pay. That frames the stakes for labor and management.</p>

    <h2>Who Should Use This Calculator</h2>
    <p><strong>Sports business analysts</strong> — model strike impact. Quantify the cost of labor disputes.</p>
    <p><strong>Union advisors</strong> — show members the dollar impact. Frame the stakes.</p>
    <p><strong>Fans and journalists</strong> — understand labor dynamics. What does a 30-day strike really cost?</p>
    <p><strong>Anyone in cap leagues</strong> — NBA, NFL, NHL. Model salary share and strike impact.</p>

    <h3>Understand the dollar impact of disputes</h3>
    <p>One number: lost earnings. Whether you're a player, agent, or analyst — know the cost before the strike. The calculator gives you that number in seconds.</p>

    <h3>Union strike fund and benefits</h3>
    <p>Some unions have strike funds that partially replace lost wages. The calculator shows gross lost earnings — strike benefits (if any) reduce the net impact. Use the output as a baseline; adjust for your union's specific support.</p>

    <h3>Escrow and deferred pay</h3>
    <p>In some leagues, a portion of salary is held in escrow. Strike impact may affect both base pay and escrow. The calculator uses gross salary — for detailed modeling, factor in escrow rules. The daily rate (salary ÷ 365) remains the same; apply it to the relevant portion.</p>
